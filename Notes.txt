Shadcn UI is not a component library but a collection of components to be copied and pasted

npx create-next-app@15.0.3
npx shadcn@2.1.6 init
npm install @tiptap/react @tiptap/pm @tiptap/starter-kit
I used specific version - npm install @tiptap/react@2.10.2 @tiptap/pm@2.10.2 @tiptap/starter-kit@2.10.2
some other tiptap things I installed I dont remember
npm install zustand@5.0.1 --lpd

nextjs is build atop react. Allows automatic routing, server + client side rendering instead of just client,
etc - things that react does not do

every component in app folder is a server component by default. They are static so you cannot use hooks with them(like in Editor).
So we need to add "use client"

NPM v7+ installs peerDependencies by default; this is not the case with previous versions of NPM.
NPM modules must name specific versions of their peerDependencies
If you already have a peerDependency installed, but not with a version named by the module, then NPM v7+ will throw an error
Adding --legacy-peer-deps ignores this new requirement, at the risk of introducing breaking changes


Peer dependencies are a type of dependency in npm that specify a package which your library or plugin requires to function, but expects the consuming project to provide it.
 They are used primarily when developing libraries or plugins that are meant to be used in conjunction with a specific host package, such as a framework or a core library.
 The key purpose of peer dependencies is to ensure compatibility between the library and the host package by requiring the consumer to install a compatible version of the peer dependency.

This mechanism prevents the duplication of the same package in multiple versions within the dependency tree, which can lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior.
 For example, if a React component library declares React as a peer dependency, the host application must install React, ensuring that only one copy of React is used across the entire project.
 This is crucial because if each library installed its own copy of React, it could result in multiple versions of React being loaded, causing issues like instance of checks failing.

StartetKit keeps track of history(ctrlZ)
the whole editor store implementation is fucking bonkers I do not know how i did it


Instead of
className={`${isActive ? "bg-blue-500" : "bg-gray-500"} text-white px-4 py-2`}
You can write
className={cn("text-white px-4 py-2", isActive ? "bg-blue-500" : "bg-gray-500")}
